        <p>We had accessibility in mind from the start, and considered this when choosing the layout
            and color-scheme of our website. We initially wanted to go with a design that implemented
            the colors of the Italian flag, but quickly realized this would be hard to make accessible,
            especially for individuals who are color-blind. Instead, we went with an elegant beige and
            black color-scheme with high contrasts. We kept the layout clear, with easy navigation of
            the website. You can also easily navigate the website by using only the Tab and Enter keys,
            which is a very important aspect of web accessibility.</p>

        <p>To make sure that our website was compatible for people with dyslexia, we used sans serif font,
            which is plain and evenly spaced. Sans serif font makes text more readable for individuals
            with visual impairments. For the same reason, we used dark colored text on a light background.
            An “antique white" background was used instead of plain white, because white might be
            too dazzling. We avoided green, red and pink colors throughout the website, as these colors
            could cause issues for people with colorblindness and dyslexia. Color contrast accessibility
            validator showed no color contrast issues.</p>

        <p>We included the main page regions to our website, such as header, navigation, main content and footer,
            so that it would be easier for web browsers to identify them.</p>

        <p>After uploading the first version of our website to AcChecker, the results were no known problems and no
            likely problems. However, we did get 27 potential problems. The majority of them were related to the image:
            image text, Alt text, etc. We fixed the problem by renaming the image and adding a brief description using
            the alt attribute. We changed the description from “pizza” to “photo of mozzarella pizza” because we
            realized that the first description might be confusing to someone using a screen-reader. We have also
            checked all the headers to make sure that they were used as section headers and not to format text.</p>

        <p>In terms of SEO, we used keywords such as restaurant, Italian, Oslo and pizza throughout the website. We placed
            relevant information in the correct hierarchy, for instance information regarding the dishes.</p>
